Here is a sample `requirements.txt` file for a Python project:
```
# requirements.txt

# Python packages
requests==2.25.1
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
numpy==1.20.0
pandas==1.3.5
matplotlib==3.4.3
scikit-learn==1.0.2

# Development dependencies
pytest==6.2.5
black==21.12b0
isort==5.10.1
flake8==4.0.1
```
This file specifies the dependencies required for the project, including:

* `requests` for making HTTP requests
* `beautifulsoup4` for parsing HTML and XML documents
* `numpy` and `pandas` for numerical computing and data analysis
* `matplotlib` for data visualization
* `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks

The development dependencies include:

* `pytest` for unit testing
* `black` for code formatting
* `isort` for sorting imports
* `flake8` for code linting

To use this file, simply create a new file named `requirements.txt` in the root of your project directory and copy the contents into it. Then, you can install the dependencies using `pip` by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
