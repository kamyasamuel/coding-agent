Network Security Project
=========================

This project aims to provide a comprehensive network security solution using Python.

The project consists of the following components:

1. Network Scanner: Scans the network for active devices and identifies potential vulnerabilities.
2. Packet Sniffer: Captures and analyzes network packets to detect suspicious activity.
3. Firewall Configuration: Configures the firewall to block malicious traffic.
4. Encryption Tool: Encrypts and decrypts data to ensure secure communication.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure the firewall settings in `firewall_config.py`
3. Run the network scanner using `python network_scanner.py`
4. Run the packet sniffer using `python packet_sniffer.py`
5. Use the encryption tool using `python encryption_tool.py`
